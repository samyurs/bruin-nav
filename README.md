# üêª bruin-nav

**BruinNav** is a mobile app designed to help Bruins navigate, understand, and connect with UCLA's complex and historic campus.

Through an interactive, user-friendly map, students can easily locate buildings, restrooms, water fountains, printers, and study spots with a smart search function. Tapping on any building reveals detailed information like hours of operation, floor plans, and departments housed inside, along with all available amenities.

BruinNav features **Community Notes**, a student-powered section where users can share tips on navigating tricky hallways, finding shortcuts, reporting elevator outages, and more. Notes can be upvoted or downvoted to prioritize the most helpful information.

If your credentials match a user that you have registered, it will take you to a homepage that looks like this:

### Backend
1. **Make sure to edit the .env file with your credentials. Follow the template given inside the file.**

2. **Then run the following commands**
```bash
cd bruin-nav/Backend
npm install dotenv
npm install bcryptjs
```

3. **Then you can start the server**
```bash
node server.js
```

4. **It should output the following if you connected properly**
```bash
Server running on port 5050
MongoDB connected
```

5. **Everytime you register or login, your console in the terminal where MondoDB is connected would output something like this**

POST /api/users/register

POST /api/users/login

POST /api/users/login

POST /api/users/register

6. **You can use postman.com to test if your backend is connected if you're unsure. I've attatched screenshot examples of what the header, body, and request should look like.**
